  CMS is a big collaboration of three thousand people spread over several institutions across five continents. It is very important to bring the collaborators up to speed in terms of learning about the CMS detector and computing software in order to contribute towards the physics analysis. CMS maintains the <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBook">WorkBook</a> as much as up-to-date as possible to help guide about every aspect of the CMS detector. In addition to it, several <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/Tutorials">tutorials and workshops</a> are held regularly to give a hands on experience to the users. There are tutorials on PAT (Physics Analysis Toolkit), <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideCrab">CRAB</a>, RooStats, Fireworks, Python in CMSSW etc. where one learns the basic CMS software tools. It is also pertinent that people are able to apply these tools. With this goal in mind, an Extended-JTerm (EJTerm) workshop was held at the <a href="https://lpc.fnal.gov/">LPC (LHC Physics Center)</a> at <a href="https://fnal.gov/">Fermilab</a> from 5-10 Jan, 2010, to help CMS physicists learn about CMS commissioning and analysis and thereby participate in significant ways to the discovery and elucidation of the new physics. Several institution contributed in organizing and preparing for this workshop. The EJTerm workshop model was very successful. To encompass yet a bigger role, the name EJTerm was changed to <b>CMS Data Analysis School (CMSDAS)</b> in 2011. The very first school with the new name CMSDAS was held at the <a href="https://lpc.fnal.gov/">LPC</a>, Fermilab in 25-29 Jan 2011. Since then CMSDAS has been held a several places worldwide.

  To prepare the participants, a series of pre-workshop online activities “extended-tutorials” are prepared in the form of exercises. Examples include the Physics Analysis Toolkit, the Fireworks event display, and the CRAB/DAS system to locate and transfer data. Several CMS institutions worked with those who signed up for CMSDAS to ensure that, when they arrive for school in January, they have already attained a working knowledge of the indispensable tools needed to confront the first CMS data.
