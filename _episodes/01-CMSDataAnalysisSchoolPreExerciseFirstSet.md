# Introduction

Welcome to the first set of CMS Data Analysis School (CMSDAS) pre-exercises. The purpose of these exercises is to become familiar with the basic software tools required to perform physics analysis at the school. Please run and complete these exercises. Throughout the exercises there will be questions for you to answer. Submit your answers in the online response form available from *the course web area* - For CMSDAS@LPC 2021, Fermilab, the complete set of links can be found at the [CMSDAS pre-exercises indico page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/966368/). A large amount of additional information about these exercises is available in the twikis that we reference. Please remember that twikis evolve but aim to provide the best information at any time.

> ## Note
> The CMSDAS exercises (pre-exercises as well as exercises during the school) are intended to be as generic as possible. However, CMSDAS is held at different CMS collaborating institutes - e.g. the LPC at Fermilab, DESY, etc.) Participants are expected to **request and obtain local (at the intended school location) computer accounts** well in advance of the school start date, to ensure they will be able to work right away. It is very important for participants to use the pre-exercises as a setup tool, so we recommend for everyone to **use the same laptop they intend to bring with them at the school** (NO computer/laptop will be provided at the school), and to **connect to the local computing resources that will be used for the school**. In most cases laptops will need to be registered to be used in the local school network, so please make sure you take care of this aspect too.

There are several sets of pre-exercises. As outlined above, if you are going through the pre-exercises in preparation to attending a CMSDAS, we strongly recommend using the laptop you intend to bring to the school and logging into the cluster local to the school.
