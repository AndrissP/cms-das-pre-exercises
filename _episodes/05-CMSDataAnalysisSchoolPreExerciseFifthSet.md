# Introduction

This exercise is intended to provide you with basic familiarity with Git and GitHub for personal and collaborative use, including terminology, commands, and user interfaces. The exercise proceeds step-by-step through a standard collaboration "Fork and Pull" workflow. This is a highly condensed version of the tutorial exercises at CMSGitTutorial. Students are encouraged to explore those more in-depth exercises if they want to learn more about using Git. There are also accompanying slides on that twiki page. Students with no experience using Git or other version control software are recommended to read at least the first set of slides.

> ## Warning
